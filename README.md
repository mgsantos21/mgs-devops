## 🧪 My Homelab
🔗 Repository: [github.com/mgsantos21/homelab](https://github.com/mgsantos21/homelab)

I'm building a fully GitOps-driven homelab running on **K3s** over bare-metal laptops, using modern DevOps tooling to simulate real production environments.

📌 Current architecture:
- **FluxCD** for GitOps deployments and reconciliation  
- **Helm** for templating and managing charts  
- **Prometheus + Grafana** for observability
- **Cloudflare** for DNS and secure public access  
- **Secrets management** with SOPS

🔜 Planned upgrades:
- Add **2 more nodes** to form a lightweight HA control plane  
- Use my beloved **Arch Linux** laptop on one node with K3s control-plane role

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Languages:** Python, Bash, YAML  
- **DevOps Tools:** GitLab CI, GitHub Actions, Docker, Kubernetes, Helm  
- **Cloud:** Azure (AZ-104 in progress)  
- **Infra as Code:** Terraform, Ansible  
- **Monitoring:** Grafana, Prometheus
